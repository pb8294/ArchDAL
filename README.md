# **CODE FOR EXPERIMENT FOR PAPER 'On the Interdependence between Data Selection and Architecture Optimization in Deep Active Learning**'

Please refer to **image_dataset** and **text_dataset** folders for image and text dataset experiments. 

The code for image datasets are developed on top of [DISTIL github repo](https://github.com/decile-team/distil) and for the text datasets are developed on top of [dal-toolbox github repo](https://github.com/dhuseljic/dal-toolbox). 

This code repository is developed on top of [DISTIL github repo](https://github.com/dhuseljic/dal-toolbox) for implementing Deep Active Learning (DAL) framework with different acquisition strategies across BERT, DISTILBERT and ROBERTA for text datasets (AGNEWS, BANKS77, DBPEDIA and QNLI). The code presented here is used as base code for TMLR paper under same name. 

Current Repository is **Version 1** for the code repository and will be constantly updated to increase efficiency of the code.
